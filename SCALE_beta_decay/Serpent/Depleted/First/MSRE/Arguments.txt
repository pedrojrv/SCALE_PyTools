MSRE Poisoning of about 1.4% without circulating bubbles and well below 1% with circulating bubbles. (Pg. 1)
Check reference 5-7 MSRE ORNL 4069

They calculated concentration in salt by equating sources and sink terms.
Parameters Used in Calculation that might be different from our calculations:
- Xe from Fission at 0.3% yield in U-235
- Xe from Iodine Decay with yield of 6.1%
- Total Yield of 6.4%
- Xenon Stripper Efficiency: 8 to 15%, they used 12% or 10% but it could as well be in the 100% efficiency (NOTE WORDING)
- Average neutron absorption cross section 1.18E6 barns averaged over the MSRE spectrum (11)
- They divide the core into three different fluid dynamic regions
- They also assume concentration constant throughout loop. 43)
- Reactor Temperature 1200 F (922K)
- Generation Rate 5.44E19 atoms per hour (44)
- Assuming Stripping Efficiency is Removal Efficiency, no feedback loop.
- Bubble-free case, Xe-135 poisoning should be 1.3 to 1.5% (NOTE WORDING)
- For simulation with no bubbles:
   - Decay in Salt is 3.4%
   - Burnup in Salt is 0.9%
   - Stripped from Salt is 31%
   - Migration to Graphite 64.7%
   - 96.4% of total poisoning is due to Xe in graphite and only 3.6% due to that in salt (Makes sense)
- With bubbles, 98% of Xenon in bubbles
- Lack of understanding in bubble void fraction and diameter so they assume 0.010 in diameter
- Not known for sure but Xe poisoning in the order 0.3 to 0.4%

Known Discrepancies:
- Generation Rate
- Fission Yields
- Not accounting for Holdup in Graphite per se
- Stripper Efficiency (they used 10 or 12 and we used 15%
