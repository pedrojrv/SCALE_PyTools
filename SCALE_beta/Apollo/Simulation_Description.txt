- First_Simulation: Testing that SCALE Alpha works by submitting sample problems for each reactor case.
- Second_Simulation: Testing different Off-gas system efficiencies (100, 50 , 15, 10 , 5, 0) with no decay.
- Third_Simulation: Testing finer off-gas system efficiencies (100, 80, 60, 40, 20, 15, 10, 5, 0) with NO decay.
